Voice App

Overview

My project will be a Voice App that will allow users to find best opinions from other users. It will allow users to log in, and to create and edit query details such as categories, location, title, and opinions. It will give the user an option to like the query and also share the query in social media. I decided to make this project so that people can get more knowledge about the available sources.

Features

--> User Sign up: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to track their own queries, based on their own categories.

--> User Login: Users will be able to login after creating a profile. Passwords will be hashed, salted, and possibly peppered.

--> Edit, Create, and Delete Categories: Users will be able to create new categories to make their queries more specific.Categories will be flexible, and can be edited, and deleted.

--> View recent queries posted: Users will be able to view a listing of recent queries, and by clicking on a recent query view details about that query.

--> Delete Queries: Users will be able to delete queries.

--> Like,Dislike,Share,Comment: Users can like or dislike the query and also can share the query on social media. The User can also comment the query.

What I'll Have to Learn

I"ll have to learn something about javaScript and how to use RESTful API. I also will have to dive deeper into Handlebar Templates -- mainly fragmenting, and reusing templates within templates.
